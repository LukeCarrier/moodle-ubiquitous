Details on applying roles to servers can be found in the [Salt administration documentation](admin/salt.md).

## Application server (`app`)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Dependencies | None |
| Dependants | `app-debug`, `app-gocd-agent` |

Application servers provide the frontend of the environment, serving the site through nginx and handing off dynamic requests to PHP-FPM pools. Each platform is isolated from neighbouring sites using local system user accounts.

### With debugging support (`app-debug`)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Dependencies | `app` |
| Dependants | None |

This role augments the `app` role with easy access to Behat's faildump and enables debugging and profiling using Xdebug.

The Behat faildump for each platform can be accessed from a browser at `/data/behat-faildump`.

Xdebug profiler output is written to `{home}/data/profiling/` for each platform when enabled. Xdebug can be managed using the following browser extensions:

* [Xdebug Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdebug-helper/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc?hl=en) for Chrome

### With blue/green deployments (`app-gocd-agent`)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Dependencies | `app`, `gocd-agent` |
| Dependants | None |

Extends the `app` role with a series of scripts and configuration for [GoCD](https://www.gocd.io/) that enables upgrades without downtime.

A suite of scripts are installed to `/usr/local/ubiquitous/bin`:

* `ubiquitous-info` - dumps the current configuration for a single site
* `ubiquitous-install-release` - installs a new release
* `ubiquitous-set-current-release` - changes the current release, priming the new release in a secondary FPM pool before switching over to it

These commands depend on platform configuration, stored in `/usr/local/ubiqutous/etc/ubiquitous-platforms` in the following format:

```
domain:basename:username:/home/dir
```

To facilitate running pipelines, the `go` agent user is allowed passwordless `sudo` to the release management commands.

## PostgreSQL database (`db-pgsql`)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Dependencies | None |
| Dependants | None |

Provides a [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) 9.5 database server with users and databases for each configured platform.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Dependencies | None |
| Dependants | `app-gocd-agent` |

Installs and configures the [GoCD](https://www.gocd.io/) agent.

## GoCD server (`gocd-server`)

| | |
